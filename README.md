# MGL-Resources

MGL is a technology consultancy company for schools.

Their curriculum team helps Primary schools make best use of technology and deliver a successful computing curriculum.
I created this website while I was working for MGL in their curriculum team during the coronavirus lockdown. The company explored different ways to support schools without consultants physically going into the school building. One idea was to give schools access to an online platform in which schools can access resources such as online video lessons and tutorial videos to support remote learning products like Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams.

The website was built using WordPress, the plugin Advanced Custom Fields was used to allow the team of curriculum consultants to easily upload their own videos and documentation resulting in a pooled set of resources.

A login system was created so content was available to schools who are signed up to MGL only.
Media queries were used to make the website responsive to different devices.
