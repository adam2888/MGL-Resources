# MGL-Resources

I designed and built this website while I was working for MGL as Primary School Computing Consultant. When Primary schools closed during the coronavirus lockdown, the comapny explored different ways to support schools without consultants physically going into the building. One idea was to give schools access to an online platform in which schools can access resources such as online video lessons and tutortial videos to support remote learning products like Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams.

The website was built using Worpress, the plugin advanced custom fields was used to allow curiculum consultants to easily upload their videos and documentation. This meant the team of consultants to easily pool all their resources together.

A login system was created so content was available to schools who are signed up to MGL only.

Media queries were used to make the website responsive to different devices.
